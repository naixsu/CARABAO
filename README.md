  <b>CARABAO</b>
 
  <i>A PhilArts 1-E Project (c) 2024</i>
</h2>

<div align="center">

**This captivating project is a heartfelt tribute to the carabao, a symbol deeply embedded in Filipino culture. The carabao, also known as the water buffalo, stands as a resilient and revered icon, embodying strength, diligence, and rural life in the Philippines.**

*The hope behind this showcase is to celebrate the carabao's significance, through a game, shedding light on its role in agriculture, its gentle nature, and its unwavering presence in the hearts of the Filipino people. It serves as a reminder of the rich heritage and traditions that form the tapestry of Philippine identity.*

### NOTES
- Assets were mostly mine, with some taken from royalty-free sources. Though, the [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) sounds were taken from their actual assets. ~~I did buy the game though and just used the assets in the .minecraft/assets folder, so it's not entirely stealing copege,~~
- While the main subject of this game is a carabao, I decided to use cow sounds instead, because it sounded tamer than a carabao's.
- Main idea of this game is [FARM](https://github.com/naixsu/FARM).
- Made this game in ~20 hours total lule.
- Ofc classic spaghetti and unoptimized code
